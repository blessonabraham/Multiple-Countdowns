####Plugin Name: Multiple Countdowns
####Description: To Set Multiple Countdowns or a Series of 10 Countdowns.
####Platform: Wordpress


#Idea Behind:
The reason for developing this plugin is that, I didn’t find any plugin in Wordpress for setting multiple countdowns. For example, if I have an event tomorrow and day after tomorrow, plugin must start countdown for tomorrow and then after tomorrow’s event it must again restart countdown for day after tomorrow


#Current Features:
1. Can set up to 10 Events
2. Use Short Code [multicountdown] to display Countdown in Pages, Posts & Widgets
3. Uses your wordpress local time
4. Set the Date and Time Like: December 4, 2015 10:00 AM
5. Must set dates in Ascending Order
 

#Working On/To DO:
1. Different Countdown Designs
2. Dynamically set the no of Events (now default is 10)
